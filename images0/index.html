            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>
                I am a self-taught web developer who is now looking to obtain a 
                lifetime job. My college years 
                were a bit too early for me personally. I have 3 years worth
                 of computer science college classes. 
                During those 3 years, I was still trying to figure what 
                I wanted to do in life. There wasn’t much balance in my life
                 in those years. But now that I am 25 years old, 
                I understand myself completely 
                and have gotten back into coding. I consider myself to 
                be advanced in HTML and CSS. 
                I’m currently working on perfecting my Java script. 
                I do plan on learning more coding languages to add more to
                 my skill set. Python was the last the language I was 
                 learning before I left school. That’s another language 
                 I look forward to coding again. Coding is like a 
                 hobby of mine, that I enjoy doing. I look forward 
                 to working for a company and become a big contribution to a 
                 team. That would help me grow both professionally and personally.
