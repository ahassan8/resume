                <h1>RICHLAND ONE MIDDLE COLLEGE</h1>
                <P>
                    I attended this school during my last year of 
                    highschool. My first 3 years were at a different 
                    highschool. At richalnd one middle college (ROMC)
                    I took college classes, one being intro to computer 
                    science. I Graduated in 2016 and prepared myself 
                    for college even though I was too young mentally.
                    I did however attend a program called Upward Bound Which
                    is a program that prepares students for college.
                    They offered the college experience on USC campus. 
                    I truly appreciate that program, because now I can look back 
                    and see how much help it was to me. Reflecting on the past is what 
                    prepares us for the future. Learning from our mistakes in the past
                    to make become better version of ourselves for the future. 
                </P>
