                Hello, Im Abdi a future web developer. Currently working
                on increasing my coding knowledge. I went to claflin University and
                then Midlands tech college in Columbia SC. I've lived in Columbia for about
                19years now. The country I moved from is Kenya. A place that I want to visit 
                to see what its like now that Im older and have been in the US for so long. 
                As far as personality, Im a quiet person who simply enjoys life. I do plan to be more 
                open and talkative as grow and build person myself to the person I want to be. 
            </p>
